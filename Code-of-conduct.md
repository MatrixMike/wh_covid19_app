# Code of Conduct

This code of conduct outlines expectations for participation in this project, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behaviour. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all. We expect the contributors of this open source project to act professionally and respectfully, and we expect our social spaces to be safe and dignified environments.

Specifically:

- Be friendly and patient: Remember you might not be communicating in someone else’s primary spoken or programming language, and others may not have your level of understanding.
- Be welcoming: Our communities welcome and support people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
- Be respectful: We are a world-wide community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. Disrespectful and unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:
    - Violent threats or language.
    - Discriminatory or derogatory jokes and language.
    - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
    - Posting, or threatening to post, people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”).
    - Insults, especially those using discriminatory terms or slurs.
    - Behavior that could be perceived as sexual attention.
    - Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors.

# Conflict Resolution

Disagreements, both social and technical, are useful learning opportunities. Seek to understand the other viewpoints and resolve differences constructively. The people who disagree should get together, try to understand each other's points of view, and work to find a design that addresses everyone's concerns.

This is usually sufficient to resolve issues. If you cannot come to an agreement, ask for the advice of a more senior member of the team.



# Questions

Asking questions is completely okay! If you have any questions, you can always post it on the issues page of github. To know more about the development process, you can have a look at this link here.

If it’s something urgent, you can always reach out to the [GDG Melbourne’s slack](http://bit.ly/join_gdgslack). You can use the #flutter channel for any dev questions you may have. You could use the #general for any other questions or reach out to Luke Sleeman ( @luke.sleeman)
