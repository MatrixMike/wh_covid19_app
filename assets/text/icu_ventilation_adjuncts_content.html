<h2>Adjuncts to ventilation</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Deep sedation</li>
    <li>
        Prone positioning
        <ul>
            <li>Strong recommendation for patients with severe ARDS</li>
            <li>12-18 hours per day</li>
            <li>May need many contiguous days of proning</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Restrictive fluid regime
        <ul>
            <li>Strong recommendation from experience to date</li>
            <li>These patients are very prone to volume-induced pulmonary oedema</li>
            <li>Use vasopressors in preference to IV fluids once initial (modest) fluid resus has occurred</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Neuromuscular blockade
        <ul>
            <li>NOT first line management</li>
            <li>Consider infusion of Cisatracurium in patient with refractory hypoxia</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Routine use of recruitment maneuvers is not recommended</li>
    <li>
        Steroids are NOT recommended
        <ul>
            <li>No evidence of benefit, and probably harm</li>
            <li>Higher rate of HAP/VAP</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Anti-viral therapies are NOT recommended</li>
    <li>
        Antibiotics
        <ul>
            <li>Antibiotics should still be given, as routine, in the initial empiric management of
                any patient with acute respiratory failure</li>
            <li>There seems to be a moderate rate of secondary bacterial infection</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Inhaled NO and prostacyclin
        <ul>
            <li>There is no evidence of benefit with either of these</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
