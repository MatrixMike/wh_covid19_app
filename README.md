# Western Health COVID-19 app

A tool to safeguard the welfare of Western Health anaesthetists during COVID19 and provide instant access to the most up-to-date information for time-critical procedures to ensure optimal patient care. This app will contain information for frontline medical staff on subjects such as:

- Putting on and taking off PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)
- Taking care of your own welfare
- Intubation checklists and steps
- Ventilation suggested initial actions and adjuncts
- ICU General Care
- ICU Tips for junior staffers
- Contact details and newsfeeds

Currently under development by a community of volunteers.

## Development process

The current development process is:

üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏èüë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è **Greg Miller** and other Western Health staff provide features, content and suggestions to the design team

‚¨áÔ∏è

üë©‚Äçüé®üë®‚Äçüé® **Marc Edwards** and other designers help design and specify features, which are then added into github issues. Check our [issues page](https://github.com/Western-Health-Covid19-Collaboration/wh_covid19_app/issues) for tasks to work on.

‚¨áÔ∏è

üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª **Developers** pick up issues and submit PRs to the project when then get approved and merged.

‚¨áÔ∏è

üñ• **CI** builds the app and deploys to phones via firebase app distribution.

## The Plan

The app will have these screens and sections:

![App information architecture](docs/Flow-Diagram.png "The information architecture of the app")

We will rapidly build out functionality and screens. The plan is to ship early, and ship often, deploying new builds at least once a day via CI.

Currently all data will be stored inside the app, with no CMS or web services. The app should have minimal logic, and instead just focuses on providing important information in a mobile friendly format.

## Getting Started & Development

You will need to install and setup Flutter to develop this application. You can read more on how to set up Flutter [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

**Tip!**: If you are using Visual Studio Code as your IDE (Code Editor), the [Flutter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter) is really useful and helpful to perform multiple actions such as:

- the installation of depencies
- running the application

### Installing dependencies

To install dependencies, simply run `flutter pub get` in your terminal.

### Developing the app

#### iOS

Initialise an instance of an iOS Simulator or connect physical iOS device, navigate to the cloned repo and run from root:

```sh
# from terminal

open -a simulator

cd desktop/muhnee-app
flutter run -d "iPhone"
```

#### Android

##### Keychain Certificate Setup

1. Download the `google-services.json` configuration file from the Firebase Project and move it to the directory `<PROJECT-ROOT>/android/app`
2. Get the Android Keychain by:

   ```
   keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass a
   ndroid
   ```

3. Copy either the SHA1 or the SHA256 certificate fingerprint onto the Android App on [Firebase Console]()

##### Development

If you have a device plugged in just run:

```
flutter run
```

Otherwise if you have setup [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and/or the Android Software Development Kit (SDK) you can run it over a virtual Android emulator using the Android Debug Bridge (ADB). Just simply run:

```
flutter run adb
```
