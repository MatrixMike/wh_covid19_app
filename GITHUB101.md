This document is aimed at getting started with github if you never used it.

If you're a developer there's more info at [README.md](https://github.com/Western-Health-Covid19-Collaboration/wh_covid19_app/blob/master/README.md).

# How can you help?

Look into [issues assigned to Gregg](https://github.com/Western-Health-Covid19-Collaboration/wh_covid19_app/issues?q=assignee%3Agreggmiller+is%3Aopen), then review them and see what it is the developers may be asking for. Most often this will be a further copy (written information) and content or a breakdown of an algorithm/ checklist. 

If you think you can help you can add a comment with either a simple reply or follow up question. Developers are a friendly bunch and won't be critical if you don't provide what they are looking for. You'll need to be logged in in order to make comments.
  
You can always ask for clarification by contacting Gregg directly on the general channel on Slack GDG Melbourne.  A good way to get a feel for the process and how issues are resolved might be to look at previous issues with Gregg's name assigned and the type of answer he has given. Generally, if it doesn't answer the developer then they will have responded.

A good rule of thumb is that if you can succintly put all your thoughts into a couple paragraphs and don't expect a lot of back and forth, it's ok. If it's complicated, other ways of communication will be more efficient.


# What is Github?
Github is a good place where developers write and combine their individual `source code` (computer instructions, the magic bits that power all sorts of electronic apps) with each other so they can collaborate in teams when building complex applications. 

That's only one of the tools they use to get stuff done. While other tools are very technical, Github has a couple of things that are meant to be used by people who are not technical at all.

## Is it free?
Yes.

Everything in the scope of this project is free and you don't need a credit card or any other means of payment. Although there are some paid features in Github, none of them are necessary.

## Do I need an account?
There are many ways to participate in this project. Some ways need you to log into github, some don't.

- If you want to report a problem and follow up on it, the best way would be to create an `issue` (more below). That requires a github login.
- If you want to download the app you do NOT need a github account (see the links at the top of this page). 
- If you still want to participate but don't want to do it through github, you can still join us on slack (a kind of social chat app that software developers love) at [GDG Melbourne's slack](http://bit.ly/join_gdgslack). Go into the `#general` channel, and some friendly face may be able to help you out. 

You can use any email you wish when signing up - it can be your work email or personal one, there's no drawbacks in using either. The only time it should matter is if you lose the password and need to receive a reset password link. 

Note that the slack `#general` channel is not specific to this app, so different people have different priorities and may even not be aware that this app exists. However if you're stuck or lost that's a good place for asking for help.

## What is an "issue"? How do I create it?

Github helps its users communicate each other through `"issues"`. Think of it as a tunneled conversation about a specific narrow topic. 

We create `issues` for different purposes, such as features we want to have, or bugs that were found. It's very easy to create an issue, and good practice says that you'll need to:

- search or browse for existing issues, so we don't report the same thing twice

After that, hit the green button 
![Create issue](docs/create_new_issue.png)
 
- create a short, easy to remember title for it
- create the first comment, explaining as clear and concise as possible what the goal is

### What happens next?

- After an `issue` is created, you and other people can add comments to it
- Eventually some developer would assign herself/himself to work on it
- Eventually that developer or another one will finish the work on it
- The `source code` (computer instructions) produced as part of that work follows a set of procedures - like a medical protocol - that ends up in producing a new version of the app, that would be automatically updated into mobile's phones. This can happen very quickly or very slowly, depending on a number of factors such as urgency, developer's available time and technical hurdles.

on top of that:
- You can edit your own comments at any time. However it's not advised unless for minor corrections, since that can break the communication flow (what if somebody replied to something you deleted?). Good practice tells us to ADD text to the end of the comment, explaining what we changed.
- Developers may get stuck with something either a) deeply technical, b) deeply domain specific (that means it's something that only Health professionals are suited to answer), or anywhere in between. They may add comments with their questions, and once their concerns are settled they may resume work on the `issue`
- Only team members with special privileges can assign tasks to either themselves or others. It's expected to learn a bit more of ins and outs of github before a person can do that. Because with those bigger powers come bigger responsibilities.
